  </section>

  <section>

    Fusion Soul Form<br/>
    Pit of Nothingness</p>
    <p>nD1000 is introduced – the God of Storylines. Dur V remains stronger but lets Thorne carry the power. The story is infinite. It loops endlessly.</p>
    <p>The verse ends with Thorne and Velrya as eternal parents. All children are born. Niah’s role shifts. The rewritten universe remains intact. Dur V continues writing from beyond time.</p>
    <p>As war and fate collide, Thorne gathers his children—each born of chaos and love.<br/>
    He gives up his life, piece by piece, splitting his divine power equally:<br/>
    Veltrix becomes the Goddess of Emotion – She feels the pain, joy, rage, fear, and hope of all beings. With a whisper, she can heal or destroy a soul.<br/>
    Juniya becomes the Goddess of Time – Her tears control years, her smile pauses reality, and her rage bends past and future into one loop.<br/>
    Zyra becomes the Goddess of Evil / Demons / The Devil – She holds authority over all darkness in all fiction. All who embrace sin bow to her command.<br/>
    Velson and Zyinx, once quiet warriors, become closer than brothers—spiritual twins.</p>
    <p>Five hundred years pass.<br/>
    The world is peaceful. War is memory. Sin is silence. But Thorne… still watches.<br/>
    He returns—not to rule, but to rewrite.<br/>
    “Let peace be not forced… but earned.”<br/>
    He fuses with Zyinx and Velson. Three souls become One Being. They no longer have names. They become:<br/>
    The One Who’s Everything… and Nothing. 100x.<br/>
    They are the source. The thought. The infinite. The void. The ink. The rewrite. No beginning. No end. Only balance.</p>
    <p>Planet Ruptured: Zyra’s Domain<br/>
    As part of the divine system, Thorne writes into existence a new world: Ruptured.<br/>
    A burning black planet that floats across all dimensions, visible only to the guilty.<br/>
    Zyra rules it with demonic elegance. She captures sinners across realities. So far, she has taken 3,976 souls.<br/>
    But not alone…<br/>
    Veltrix stands by, following Daddy’s Rules.<br/>
    She ensures only the right people are punished—no innocents, no revenge. If Zyra steps out of line, Veltrix stops her instantly.<br/>
    Their balance is fragile, yet unbreakable.</p>
    <p>Veltrix meditates across galaxies, calming stars. Juniya weaves time with her hands, creating timelines of peace. Zyra watches over sin, collecting it into her burning palms. Velson sits in silence, seeing every possibility. Zyinx walks among the innocent, smiling, guiding, teaching.<br/>
    And above them all…<br/>
    The Fusion of Thorne, Velson, and Zyinx watches from the stars. Not a god. Not a king. Just... The One.</p>
    <p>Life Is Reborn<br/>
    As the universe settles, the last ripple forms a new breath:<br/>
    Life is Reborn. Human is Made. Reproduction has Arrived.<br/>
    A new world begins. A second chance unfolds. The legacy of Thorne… becomes the foundation of existence.</p>
    <p>No hero remains. No villain reigns. Only the children of balance. Only the legacy of Thorne.</p>
